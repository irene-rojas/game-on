This was a group project created for the full-stack coding class at George Washington University. 
I did front-end work on the landing page, the "find an event" section, and the "create an event" section. 
I created the logo with Adobe Photoshop.
The landing page elements were created dynamically with jQuery. 
The "find an event" and "create an event" sections were coded in the HTML, but activated by show/hide commands in jQuery. 
I found the photos that display in the background.
